# Weekly Challenge 02te: Thinking Logically
# CS/MATH 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2024
***

Each Weekly Challenge (WC) invites you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. They may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated.

The first few Weekly Challenges, including this one, get you used to logical thinking, without necessarily relying on formal course work. This mode of thinking is required and developed in this course.

# Purpose

This WC familiarizes you with both the process that future WCs will follow and the kind of thinking that will be required for them.

# Background and Requirements

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- familiarity with high school mathematics
- a problem solving and logical approach.
- the willingness to work through the LaTeX source
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Grading
